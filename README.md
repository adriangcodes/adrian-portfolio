# Introduction

This site serves two purposes:
1. Submission for Coder Academy DEV1001 Assignment 1
2. Live site for my professional portfolio

# Changes from Wireframes

There are two changes from wireframes: 
1. Removal of the About page. Given the UX and level of content detail on the Home page, the About page felt redundant.
2. Mobile nav shifting from burger pop-out to text line.

The Projects page is fully functional (same UX as Blog), pending real-world content.

# Images and Icons

All images and icons are hosted on Cloudinary.

# Domain

I have purchased the domain adriang.dev to host both website and a work-based email address.

Simultaneous to this site being submitted for DEV1001 Assignment 1, the site will be pushed live via Netlify connected to my Github repo.

https://www.adriang.dev/

The site will also feature Google tracking tags to connect with Google Analytics and Google Search Console.
