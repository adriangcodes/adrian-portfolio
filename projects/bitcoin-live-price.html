                <h1>Bitcoin Live Price</h1>
                    <p id="btcLivePrice"></p>    
                <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin</a> is a decentralised digital currency, invented in 2008 by an anonymous figure (or group) known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments and managed by banks, Bitcoin operates on a peer-to-peer network using blockchain technology — a public ledger that records every transaction across thousands of computers worldwide.</p>
                    <p>At its core, Bitcoin is designed to be a form of money that doesn’t rely on intermediaries. Instead of trusting a central authority, users rely on cryptographic proof and network consensus to validate transactions. New Bitcoins are created through a process called “mining”, where computers or processors solve complex mathematical puzzles to confirm blocks of transactions. This not only secures the network but also introduces new coins into circulation, with a maximum cap of 21 million — making Bitcoin deflationary by design.</p>
                    <p>One of Bitcoin’s biggest appeals is its independence from traditional financial systems. It enables fast, global transactions without requiring permission from banks or governments, and offers users greater control over their own money. For some, it’s a tool for financial freedom; for others, it’s an emerging asset class and a hedge against inflation.</p>
                    <p>Since its launch, Bitcoin has sparked an entire industry of cryptocurrencies and blockchain innovation, influencing how we think about finance, security, and the future of the internet. While it remains volatile and often misunderstood, Bitcoin continues to gain traction as both a technology and a store of value.</p>
                <h2>How is the price of Bitcoin calculated?</h2>
                    <p>The price of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand across global exchanges — but there’s no single “official” price. Instead, the market value constantly shifts as buyers and sellers trade BTC in real time. Prices vary slightly between platforms, depending on liquidity and trading volume.</p>
                    <p>To deliver accurate pricing on this site, I use the open-source Bitcoin Price API released by Block (formerly Square). This tool is part of their suite of treasury management solutions for organisations holding Bitcoin. Rather than relying on a single exchange, Block’s API aggregates live pricing data from multiple sources and calculates a reliable mid-market rate. This helps eliminate bias from any one exchange and ensures more consistent pricing across different use cases.</p>
                    <p>Block developed this API to help companies manage Bitcoin holdings transparently, and it’s freely available to the public under an open-source licence. It’s a great example of open financial infrastructure — and exactly the kind of tool that supports developers, startups, and anyone looking to build on Bitcoin in a clean, auditable way.</p>
                    <p>You can learn more about the API and Block’s broader Bitcoin initiatives <a href="https://block.xyz/inside/block-releases-open-source-tools-for-bitcoin-treasury-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
