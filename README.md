# Introduction

This site serves two purposes:
1. Submission for Coder Academy DEV1001 Assignment 1
2. Live site for my professional portfolio

# Changes from Wireframes

The only change from wireframes to note is the removal of the About page. Given the UX and level of content detail on the Home page, the About page felt redundant.

The Projects page is fully functional, pending real-world content.

# Domain

I have purchased the  domain a5g5.com to host both website and a work-based email address.

Simultaneous to this site being submitted for DEV1001 Assignment 1, the site will be pushed live via Netlify connected to my Github repo.

The site will also feature Google tracking tags to connect with Google Analytics and Google Search Console.
