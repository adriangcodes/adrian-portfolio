            <article>
                <p>
                    SatoshiFund is a full-stack web app we built as a way to explore what peer-to-peer crypto lending could look like in practice.
                    The concept is pretty straightforward: borrowers request loans, and lenders can fund them — with all loans backed 1:1 by crypto collateral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that felt like a real product, not just a school project, so we focused on building out core functionality
                    with a clean structure and solid logic behind the scenes.
                </p>

                <h2>What We Used</h2>
                <p>
                    SatoshiFund is built using the MERN stack — that’s <strong>MongoDB</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>Node.js</strong>.
                    We also used <strong>Jest</strong> for testing to make sure key features worked as expected.
                    On the backend, we kept things modular and easy to follow, while on the frontend we aimed for a simple, responsive UI that gets the job done.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Authentication is handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and we set up permission levels so that admins and regular users have different access rights.
                </p>

                <h2>Key Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Loan Requests and Funding:</strong> Borrowers can create a loan request with the amount they need. Lenders can browse active requests
                    and choose to fund one. As a safeguard, borrowers must have enough collateral in their wallet to fully back the loan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Wallets and Transfers:</strong> Every user gets a digital wallet. When a loan is funded, we automatically transfer the right amounts
                    between the lender and borrower wallets, and log those transfers with time and transaction details.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Smart Automation:</strong> We added logic that calculates when loans are expected to be completed, based on the terms selected.
                    This helps keep things consistent and reduces the chance of manual error.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Admin Tools:</strong> Admin users can manage platform data, update user info, and view the full list of loan activity.
                    Regular users only have access to their own information and actions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Testing:</strong> We made sure the backend was properly tested. This meant spinning up a temporary test database each time,
                    so our real data stayed untouched. It also helped us catch bugs early and confirm that routes and logic were working properly.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What We Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the bigger challenges was managing the relationships between different parts of the system — like linking a deal to a loan request,
                    and that loan request to a specific interest term. We had to make sure those connections stayed accurate and up to date.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We also had to think carefully about timing and state changes — for example, when a deal is created, it needs to update the borrower’s loan status,
                    move funds, and record the transaction, all in the right order.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Along the way, we refined our code structure, improved how we handled errors, and made sure our logic could scale if the project kept growing.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    SatoshiFund was a great learning experience and a chance to apply our skills to a real-world use case. We got to work on everything from backend logic
                    to frontend components, and learned a lot about clean architecture, secure user flows, and building around financial rules.
                </p>
